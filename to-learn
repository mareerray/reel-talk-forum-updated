âœ… Git instruction
To merge your branch (maire) with your friend's branch (fateme), follow these steps:

- Switch to your branch (maire):
```
git checkout maire
```
- Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
```
git fetch origin
````

- Merge your friend's branch (fateme) into yours:
```
git merge origin/fateme
```
If there are no conflicts, the merge will complete successfully. If conflicts occur, Git will notify you. Resolve them manually in the affected files, then:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
````

- Push the merged branch back to GitHub:
```
git push origin maire
````

Now, your maire branch contains the updates from fateme. If you were planning to merge fateme into main, let me know, and I can guide you on that too! ðŸš€
